### Meetings

The contributors and maintainers of all OCI projects have weekly meetings every Wednesday at 2:00 PM (USA Pacific).

Based on activity and project needs, meetings may return to a lower frequency in the future; for example twice or once a month. This README will be updated as well as the iCal entry below if and when that occurs.

You can also download meeting details as an [iCalendar][rfc5545] format invite [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/linuxfoundation.org_i0sado0i37eknar51vsu8md5hg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) or view the full Google Calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=linuxfoundation.org_i0sado0i37eknar51vsu8md5hg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).
